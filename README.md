  Summary:
 -________
 +------------
 +  Every year farmers plan their crop schedules based on time in the greenhouse and time in the field, and plan around preferred planting date, first available planting date (after reasonable threat of frost), or harvest date. Field planner eliminates the need to count out days, and after creating a crop profile, the dates can be generated around one date, or customized further. A greenhouse calendar, field calendar and date vs space schedules are generated.
